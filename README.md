# ckb-tui

A TUI for ckb, based on ckb-sdk. Currently under heavy development, not able to be used yet.

Run with `cargo run -- -r [HTTP RPC endpoint of CKB node] -r [TCP RPC endpoint of CKB node]`, such as `cargo run -- -r http://192.168.15.189:8114`

Only recommend for connecting self-deployed nodes.
